# GOOD NEWS THIS IS NO LONGER NEEDED
This was a workaround to fix a bug in older versions of the now cli (store version < v1.1.2 and @servicenow/cli < v26) in which the tool would wipe out your event mappings when you redeployed your component.  That has been fixed!  You still have to map manually the first time but from then on you're safe.

Download the [latest version of now-cli](https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/application/9085854adbb52810122156a8dc961910) from the store to fix this.
